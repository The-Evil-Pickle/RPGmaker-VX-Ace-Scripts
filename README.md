Scripts for RPGmaker VX Ace


For an example of how to use these scripts, check out the "script examples" project (you should be able to open the project file with rpgmaker once you extract it)

List of scripts:
 * TFLayers: A system for changing an actor's appearence in multiple different ways, without requiring new sprites for every possible combination.
 * Craftshop: A crafting system that uses the shop menu, but each purchase requires a list of ingredients instead of / in addition to gold.
 * InputWordNumbers: Ask the player to choose a combination of words from pre-defined lists.
